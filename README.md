# How to Use Maya Math

Maya Math is a web-based tool to calculate the Highest Common Factor (HCF) and Least Common Multiple (LCM) of a set of numbers. Here's how you can use it:

### 1. **Input Numbers**
   - Enter a list of positive integers, separated by commas (e.g., `12, 18, 24`).
   - Ensure that all numbers are separated by commas with no extra spaces.

### 2. **Select Operation**
   - Choose between **HCF** (Highest Common Factor) or **LCM** (Least Common Multiple) from the dropdown menu.

### 3. **Click "Find"**
   - Press the **Find** button to calculate the HCF or LCM of the numbers you entered.

### 4. **View Result**
   - The result (either HCF or LCM) will appear below the input field once the calculation is done.

### 5. **Share the Page**
   - You can easily share the page on social media platforms:
     - **Facebook**
     - **Twitter**
     - **LinkedIn**
